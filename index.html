<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>I have always been interested in programming but I never really took action to try and create something. 
My excuse was always "oh but I don't have any experience blah blah blah". So this website is probably going to consist of many ideas. :)</p>

<h2><a href="record.html">Idea 1: Record</a></h2>
<p>I like to record song covers and, I think it would be interesting to be able to do directly on the website.</p>

<h2>Idea 2: 2D Game</h2>
<p>Maplestory was the game that really made me enjoy the experience back then in the community and, 
creating something simple along those lines would be fun.</P>
